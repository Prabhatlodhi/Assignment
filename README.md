## About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Prabhat, and I'm passionate about building user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. One of my recent projects is a userform that allows users to input their information and hobbies, with an amazing UI design and support for both dark and light modes.

### Project Highlights

- **User Input**: The userform I built is capable of capturing various user inputs, such as username, country selection, and multiple hobbies.
- **UI Design**: I've focused on creating an engaging and visually appealing user interface for the form, ensuring an enjoyable user experience.
- **Dark and Light Modes**: To enhance the user experience and accommodate user preferences, the userform includes support for both dark and light modes. Users can seamlessly switch between the two modes with a simple click.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: I utilized HTML and CSS to structure and style the userform, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing layout.
- **React**: I leveraged React, a popular JavaScript library, to handle the dynamic behavior of the form and manage user input.
- **State Management**: Through the use of React's state management capabilities, I ensured that user inputs were properly captured and reflected in the form's UI.
