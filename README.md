## About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Prabhat, and I'm passionate about building user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. One of my recent projects is a userform that allows users to input their information and hobbies, with an amazing UI design and support for both dark and light modes.

### Project Highlights

- User Input Capture: The userform is designed to capture various user inputs, including username, country selection, and multiple hobbies. Users can easily provide their information through the form.

- Engaging UI Design: Special attention has been given to creating an engaging and visually appealing user interface for the form. The design elements are carefully chosen to enhance the overall user experience.

- Dark and Light Modes: The userform offers support for both dark and light modes. This feature allows users to customize the appearance of the form based on their preferences. With a simple click, users can seamlessly switch between the two modes.

- Responsive Design: The userform is optimized for different devices, including the iPad Mini and iPhone SE. It ensures that the form displays properly and is fully functional on these specific devices, providing a consistent user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: I utilized HTML and CSS to structure and style the userform, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing layout.
- **React**: I leveraged React, a popular JavaScript library, to handle the dynamic behavior of the form and manage user input.
- **State Management**: Through the use of React's state management capabilities, I ensured that user inputs were properly captured and reflected in the form's UI.
